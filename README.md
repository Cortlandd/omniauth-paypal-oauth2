# OmniAuth PayPal OAuth2 Strategy

Strategy to authenticate with PayPal via OmniAuth.

Get your API key at: https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/ in the section **RESTApps**. Note the Client ID and the Client Secret.

**Note**: You generate separate keys for development (sandbox) and production (live) with each application you register.
Use the [config Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/config) to organize your keys and keep them safe.

For more details, read the PayPal docs: https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/identity/


## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "omniauth-paypal-oauth2"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-paypal-oauth2


## PayPal API Setup

* Go to 'https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/'
* Select your project.
* Scroll down to 'APP SETTINGS' for each 'SANDBOX' and 'LIVE'.
* Set `<YOURDOMAIN>/users/auth/paypal_oauth2/callback` as Return URL.
* Make sure "Log In with PayPal" is enabled and Save.
* Go to Credentials, then select the "OAuth consent screen" tab on top, and provide an 'EMAIL ADDRESS' and a 'PRODUCT NAME'
* Wait 10 minutes for changes to take effect.


## Usage

Here's an example for adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :paypal_oauth2, ENV["PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID"], ENV["PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET"]
end
```

You can now access the OmniAuth PayPal OAuth2 URL: `/auth/paypal_oauth2`

**Note**: While developing your application, if you change the scope in the initializer you will need to restart your app server. Remember that either the 'email' or 'profile' scope is required!


## Configuration

If you click from your [Applications Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/applications/) in your Application on "Advanced Options" in the "APP SETTINGS" section and "Log In with PayPal" subsection, you can configure several options:

* `Basic authentication`: The unique identifier PPID (PayPal ID) is provided. No additional customer information. **Not customizable**.

* `Personal Information`:
    * `Full name`: Permits the Name of the customer.
    * `Date of birth`: Permits the date of birth of the customer.
    * `Age range`: Permits an approximate age range of the customer.

* `Address Information`:
    * `Email address`: Permits the email address of the customer.
    * `Street address`: Permits the street address of the customer (Street name, House number).
    * `City`: Permits the city name where the customer resides.
    * `State`: Permits the state in which the city is located.
    * `Country`: Permits the country in which both state and city are located.
    * `Zip code`: Permits the Zip code of the customer.
    * `Phone`: Permits the phone number of the customer.

* `Account Information`:
    * `Account status (verified)`: Permits a boolean which indicates whether the customer is verified by PayPal or not.
    * `Account type`: Permits a string which indicates the account type of the PayPal customer (e.g.: PERSONAL, BUSINESS).
    * `Account creation date`: Permits the date on which the PayPal account got created.
    * `Time zone`: Permits the time zone in which the PayPal customer is located.
    * `Locale`: Permits a locale string which indicates where the PayPal customer is.
    * `Language`: Permits the language the customer uses on PayPal.


## Auth Hash

Here's an example of an authentication hash available in the callback by accessing `request.env["omniauth.auth"]`:

```ruby
{
    provider: "paypal",
    uid: "bathjJwvdhKjgfgh8Jd745J7dh5Qkgflbnczd65dfnw",
    info: {
        name: "John Smith",
        email: "example@example.com",
        first_name: "John",
        last_name: "Smith",
        given_name: "John",
        family_name: "Smith",
        location: "Moscow",
        phone: "71234567890"
    },
    credentials: {
        token: "token",
        refresh_token: "refresh_token",
        expires_at: 1355082790,
        expires: true
    },
    extra: {
        account_creation_date: "2008-04-21",
        account_type: "PERSONAL",
        user_id: "https://www.paypal.com/webapps/auth/identity/user/bathjJwvdhKjgfgh8Jd745J7dh5Qkgflbnczd65dfnw",
        address: {
            country: "US",
            locality: "San Jose",
            postal_code: "95131",
            region: "CA",
            street_address: "1 Main St"
        },
        language: "en_US",
        locale: "en_US",
        verified_account: true,
        zoneinfo: "America/Los_Angeles",
        age_range: "31-35",
        birthday: "1982-01-01"
    }
}
```

### Devise

First define your application id and secret in `config/initializers/devise.rb`. Do not use the snippet mentioned in the [Usage](https://github.com/jonhue/omniauth-paypal-oauth2#usage) section.

Configuration options can be passed as the last parameter here as key/value pairs.

```ruby
require "omniauth-paypal-oauth2"
config.omniauth :paypal_oauth2, "PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID", "PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET", { }
```

Then add the following to 'config/routes.rb' so the callback routes are defined.

```ruby
devise_for :users, :controllers => { :omniauth_callbacks => "users/omniauth_callbacks" }
```

Make sure your model is omniauthable. Generally this is "/app/models/user.rb"

```ruby
devise :omniauthable, :omniauth_providers => [:paypal_oauth2]
```

Then make sure your callbacks controller is setup.

```ruby
class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
  def paypal_oauth2
      # You need to implement the method below in your model (e.g. app/models/user.rb)
      @user = User.from_omniauth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])

      if @user.persisted?
        flash[:notice] = I18n.t "devise.omniauth_callbacks.success", :kind => "PayPal"
        sign_in_and_redirect @user, :event => :authentication
      else
        session["devise.paypal_data"] = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
        redirect_to new_user_registration_url
      end
  end
end
```

and bind to or create the user

```ruby
def self.from_omniauth(access_token)
    data = access_token.info
    user = User.where(:email => data["email"]).first

    # Uncomment the section below if you want users to be created if they don't exist
    # unless user
    #     user = User.create(name: data["name"],
    #        email: data["email"],
    #        password: Devise.friendly_token[0,20]
    #     )
    # end
    user
end
```

For your views you can login using:

```erb
<%= link_to "Sign in with PayPal", user_paypal_oauth2_omniauth_authorize_path %>

<%# Devise prior 4.1.0: %>
<%= link_to "Sign in with PayPal", user_omniauth_authorize_path(:paypal_oauth2) %>
```
